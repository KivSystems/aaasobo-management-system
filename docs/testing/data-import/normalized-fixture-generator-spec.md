# Normalized Fixture Generator Spec

## Purpose

Define a deterministic normalized-import fixture generator for shared testing.

This spec is for generating normalized import artifacts (CSV set and optional zip) from fixed rules, without randomness, so every developer can reproduce the same dataset from the same parameters.

## Source Control Policy

- Commit:
  - generator code
  - this spec and usage README
- Do not commit:
  - generated normalized `.csv`
  - generated normalized `.zip`

## Required CLI Parameters

All parameters are required:

- `--from YYYY-MM-DD`
- `--completed-until YYYY-MM-DD`
- `--to YYYY-MM-DD`

Date constraints:

- `from <= completed-until <= to`

## Optional CLI Parameters

- `--instructors COUNT` defaults to `10` and must be at least `2`

## Fixed Global Rules

- Timezone is fixed to `Asia/Tokyo` (not configurable).
- Seeded faker generation with a constant seed.
- No dependency on current date/time.
- Same inputs should produce stable outputs for the same faker/package version.

## Dataset Size

- instructors: configured by `--instructors`
- customers: `instructors * 10`
- every customer has 2 children

Derived totals:

- children: `instructors * 20`
- subscriptions: `instructors * 10`
- recurring classes: `instructors * 20` (see plan mapping below)

## Plan Mapping

Use four plans:

- `月2,180円プラン / 2,180 yen/month Plan`: Program Original, weekly 1
- `月3,180円プラン / 3,180 yen/month Plan`: Program Original, weekly 2
- `月13,980円プラン / 13,980 yen/month Plan Native A`: Native A, weekly 2
- `月13,980円プラン / 13,980 yen/month Plan Native B`: Native B, weekly 2

Mapping rule:

- odd customer index -> Program Original weekly 2
- even customer index -> Native A weekly 2

English background values:

- Program Original plans use `english_background = 0`
- Native A uses `english_background = 1`
- Native B uses `english_background = 2`

Child naming rule:

- Child `name` is always a single first name token.
- Do not encode multiple children in one name (no `&`, no `.` composite pattern).

Name style rule:

- Customer names: Japanese-style names.
- Instructor names: English-style names.
- Instructor nicknames: realistic English-style nicknames, deterministic and unique.

Instructor `english_background` alternates by index:

- odd instructor index -> `0`
- even instructor index -> `1`

## Instructor Schedule Patterns

Use two fixed patterns:

- Pattern A (Mon-Fri):
  - times: `16:00`, `16:30`, `17:00`, `17:30`, `18:00`, `18:30`
- Pattern B (Tue-Sat):
  - Tue-Fri times: `18:00`, `18:30`, `19:00`, `19:30`, `20:00`, `20:30`
  - Sat times: `09:00`, `09:30`, `10:00`, `10:30`, `11:00`, `11:30`

Assignment:

- instructor index odd -> Pattern A
- instructor index even -> Pattern B

Sunday has no slots.

## Instructor Fee Rules

Emit one active `instructor_fees.csv` row per instructor.

Field values:

- `currency = PHP`
- `effective_from = --from`
- `effective_to = empty`
- `trial_fee = 75`
- `regular_fee = 100`
- `cancel_fee = 50`
- `cancel_without_notice_fee = 100`

## Instructor Assignment for Recurring Classes

Recurring classes must be distributed across instructors with the same English
background.

Rule:

- Program Original recurring classes use odd-indexed instructors.
- Native A recurring classes use even-indexed instructors.
- Within each background pool, assign subscriptions in strict round-robin order.
- Assign both recurring classes in a subscription to different slots for the same instructor.
- Candidates are sorted by `subscription_ref`, then class sequence index.
- Each instructor has 30 unique schedule slots. Never reuse a slot; fail generation if a pool exceeds capacity.
- With the default 10 instructors, every instructor receives 20 recurring classes and retains 10 open slots for rebooking.

## Recurring Class Generation

For each subscription:

- Create `plan.weekly_class_times` recurring classes.
- Each recurring class is assigned to one instructor by the distribution rule above.
- For each recurring class, assign one weekday/time slot from the instructor's available pattern deterministically.

## Attendance Rules

- `recurring_class_attendance.csv`: both children attend all recurring classes

- `class_attendance.csv`:
  - expanded from recurring class attendance for each generated class instance

## Class Expansion Rules (`classes.csv`)

Expand each recurring class weekly across the target range `[from, to]`:

- First class is the first matching weekday/time on or after `from`.
- Next classes are every 7 days until `to` (inclusive).

Field rules:

- `status`:
  - `completed` when `class.date <= completed-until`
  - `booked` when `class.date > completed-until`
- `rebookable_until`:
  - `class.date_time + 180 days` when `status = booked`
  - empty when `status = completed`
- `is_free_trial`: `false`
- `class_code`: short deterministic unique string (stable for same inputs)

## Other Files

Generator should also emit:

- `events.csv`
- `schedules.csv` with exactly one row:
  - `date = --from`
  - `event_ref = EV0001`
- `system_status.csv`
- plus all other mandatory normalized files required by the importer contract

## Determinism Expectations

Given the same `--from`, `--completed-until`, and `--to`:

- row counts must match
- row content/order must match
- reference keys must match
- generated zip (if produced) should be reproducible
